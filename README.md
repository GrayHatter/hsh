# hsh
~~Don't use this, it's not ready!~~
You probably don't want to use this yet, while I have started to dog food this
as my shell... I'm crazy.

## Goals
  - Support *modern* pttys
  - Composable vs decomposable mode

## [De]composable mode
 A default, unconfigured install of hsh should enable all features and
 functionality. Running hsh non-interactive, or [other] should disable all
 helful, or context aware features unless explicitly enabled.

## Install
install zig (you probably need zig master, or atleast > v0.10)<br>
clone [hsh]<br>
~~`zig build run`~~<br>
`zig build`<br>
`./zig-out/bin/hsh`

(`zig build run` does some magic that causes hsh to segv)

## Hash Manifesto
  * Subsume the Unix Philosophy
    * Don't do anything you can trust something else to do.
  * Remember you're a user agent! Make all decisions to protect their best
    interests. Aggressively protect and preserve data and actions.
  * Do not clobber backlog!
    * history is immutable, once data leaves the prompt, i.e. it has been pushed
      into the scroll back, the user owns it.
  *
